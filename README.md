# Bethectus Endless
A simple procedurally generated 3D matrix environment which functions as a temple run-esque game.

Written in DarkBASIC, a derivative of the BASIC language, the game is a fairly straight forward script which generates a path through two planes, modified by procedurally generated noise. The path is textured, sound is triggered in event in-game (i.e. defeat) and a score is kept in the upper corner via  basic UI.
